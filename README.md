Tiaozhanbei code

This study combines sociological theory, psychological measurement and computational science modeling. 
In this paper, we measure the social networks and identities of students in four grades of Yuanpei College. 
Based on the empirical material obtained from qualitative interviews and data from standardized measurements, 
we conduct label-based static modeling of social networks and simulate network dynamics using information dissemination speed as a measure of organization. 
We proposed possible policies to improve the organization of the college based on our model.
